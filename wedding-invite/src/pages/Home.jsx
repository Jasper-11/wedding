        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#7b1fa2', fontSize: '1.2em' }}>
          Our story began in Melbourne in mid 2022, just as the world was opening back up. We both found ourselves in a new city, navigating fresh starts and newfound freedom after lockdowns. Somehow, we also found each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jasper was struck by her unique charm and enamoured with her curiosity. Trang was drawn to his smile and kind nature, and from our first few conversations, something genuine began to grow between us. <span role="img" aria-label="smile">üòä</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          From wandering Melbourne‚Äôs laneways and road-tripping around Victoria to relaxing on the beaches of Fiji, skiing through the snowfields of Korea, and exploring the vibrant culture, food, and family life of Vietnam, our journey has been filled with adventure, laughter, and love. These are the things we look forward to continuing to nurture together.
        </p>
        <p>
          We‚Äôre so excited to take the next step and celebrate our wedding with the people who mean the most to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for making the journey to be part of this special moment in our lives.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'green', fontSize: '1.1em' }}>
          We can‚Äôt wait to celebrate with you!
